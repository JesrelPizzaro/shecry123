1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd shecry
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the Streamlit app:

    ```bash
    streamlit run hello.py
    ```

5. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.
